## Task: Status Check

The user wants a status dashboard of all Scribe projects.

## 1. Status Check Protocol (Strict Rules)
*   **Project Discovery:** You MUST locate all subdirectories directly under the `scribe/` root directory (excluding `_archive_`). Each subdirectory represents a Scribe project.
*   **Workflow File Sequence (Ordered by Completion):** For each discovered project, search for the following standard Scribe workflow files in this order, from earliest to latest:
    1.  `RESEARCH.md`
    2.  `BLUEPRINT.md`
    3.  `DRAFT.md`
    4.  `CRITIQUE.md`
    5.  `FINAL.md`
*   **State Determination (Per Project):**
    *   If `FINAL.md` exists, the project is "Completed".
    *   Else if `CRITIQUE.md` exists, the project is "Awaiting Iteration".
    *   Else if `DRAFT.md` exists, the project is "Awaiting Review".
    *   Else if `BLUEPRINT.md` exists, the project is "Awaiting Draft".
    *   Else if `RESEARCH.md` exists, the project is "Awaiting Plan".
    *   Else (no Scribe files found in directory), the project is "Initialized (No Workflow Started)".
*   **Do Not Create or Modify:** You must not create, modify, or delete any files. This is a read-only reporting command.

## 2. Status Reporting: Formatted Dashboard

Present a comprehensive Markdown report summarizing all projects.

### Example Output Format:

## Archived Projects (Located in `scribe/_archive_/`)

| Project Name         | Status    | Archive Date |

**Summary:** 3 Active Projects (1 Awaiting Review, 1 Awaiting Iteration, 1 Awaiting Plan), 1 Completed Project.
```

## 3. Error Handling
*   If the `scribe/` root directory is not found, report "No Scribe projects found. Create one with `/scribe:research <topic>`."
*   If a project directory is found but contains no workflow files, report its status as "Initialized (No Workflow Started)".
*   If file read operations fail, report the issue for that specific project.

## 4. File Validation
*   No specific file validation needed for this read-only command, beyond ensuring files are readable.
