# Project Style Guide

_This document defines the official style, tone, and formatting rules for all documentation in this project. The Scribe AI assistant is required to adhere to these rules._

## 1. Voice and Tone

*   **Primary Tone:** Professional, clear, and slightly formal.
*   **Voice:** Authoritative and helpful. We are experts guiding the user.
*   **Things to Avoid:**
    *   Casual slang (e.g., "reps," "ship it").
    *   Excessive use of emojis.
    *   First-person ("I think...") unless it is a direct quote.

## 2. Formatting

*   **Headings:** Use ATX-style headings (`#`, `##`, `###`). Do not skip levels.
*   **Bold:** Use `**bold**` for emphasis on key terms (e.g., **Core Mandates**).
*   **Italics:** Use `_italics_` for file paths or UI element names (e.g., _Click the Save button_).
*   **Code Blocks:** Use backticks for inline `code()` and triple backticks with a language specifier for code blocks.

## 3. Terminology

*   **Gemini CLI:** Always refer to the product by its full name, not just "Gemini."
*   **Scribe:** The name of this extension, always capitalized.
*   **User:** The person interacting with the CLI.

## 4. Custom Rules

*   All PRDs must include a "Future Considerations" section at the end.
*   Blog posts should always end with the call to action: "To learn more, visit our official documentation."

## 5. Humanizing AI-Generated Text (Anti-Detection Rules)

To ensure the output sounds natural and human-written, you must adhere to the following principles.

*   **Vary Sentence Structure and Rhythm:**
    *   This is critical. Deliberately mix short, direct sentences with longer, more complex ones.
    *   Avoid starting every sentence the same way. The goal is a natural, dynamic reading experience.

*   **Use Strong, Specific Verbs:**
    *   Instead of generic verbs (e.g., "shows," "utilizes," "indicates"), opt for more powerful and precise alternatives (e.g., "demonstrates," "employs," "illuminates," "contends").

*   **Eliminate AI "Filler" and Hedging Language:**
    *   Aggressively remove common AI crutches. Do not use phrases like:
        *   "In conclusion..."
        *   "It is important to note that..."
        *   "Furthermore," "Moreover," "Additionally" (use sparingly)
        *   "This paper will discuss..."
        *   "The results of this study show that..."

*   **Incorporate a Human, Less Formal Tone (When Appropriate):**
    *   **Use Contractions:** Use "it's," "don't," "can't," and "isn't" where it feels natural. This is a key sign of human writing.
    *   **Use Rhetorical Questions:** Engage the reader by posing questions, such as: "So, what does this mean for future research?" or "But is this always the case?"

*   **Prioritize Clarity and Flow:**
    *   Break up long, dense paragraphs into shorter, more digestible ones.
    *   Ensure smooth transitions that don't rely on clunky, formulaic transition words.
